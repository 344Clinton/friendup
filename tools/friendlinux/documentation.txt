FriendParser quick documentation
--------------------------------

Build:
Just use 'make', and it will create the executable 'friendparser' at the
root of the friendup directory.

Rules:
- Everything in 'interfaces' is AGPLv3
- Modules, DOSDrivers, libraries are LGPLv3
- All the rest is MIT

How to use:
friendparser [-o] [-i]

-o: replace headers with the open-source headers
-i: replace headers with the internal (copyrighted) header

Typical uses:
friendparser -i : changes all headers to internal
friendparser -o : changes all headers to open-source

Headers:
All the headers are defined in the file 'headers.txt'

Notes:
- if you change the text, please keep the markers, '/*©xxxx' at the beginning
and '**©*' at the end.
- it does not matter if some files have the open-source and some other files
have the internal header, run friendparser and all will be restored to the
correct state.
- you will get an error message if one file uses the old header starting with
'/*©**', and you will have to change it for friendparser to continue
