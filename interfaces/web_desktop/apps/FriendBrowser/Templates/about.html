				Friend Browser is a web browser for FriendUP resources. It does now allow you to
				load <strong>https://</strong> urls if the remote site does not block
				iframes. Additionally it reads HTML5 files on your <strong>disk drives</strong>, like in "Home:".
				Finally, it can load content located on hosts in the <strong>Friend Network</strong>.

				To read more about Friend Browser, please refer to the documentation.

			<p>
				Friend Browser is often times used to read documentation and help files.
				But it becomes very useful when accessing remote disk drives that
				you have connected using the <strong>Disk catalog</strong>.
			</p>

				Enjoy a new world of networked content using Friend Browser!
